= Pro Git Second Edition Reedited

Welcome to the second edition of the Pro Git Reedited book.

Like the first edition, the second edition of Pro Git is open source under a Creative Commons license.

A couple of things have changed since open sourcing the first edition.
For one, we've moved from Markdown to the amazing Asciidoc format for the text of the book.

We've also moved to keeping the translations in separate repositories rather than subdirectories of the English repository.
See link:TRANSLATING.md[the translating document] for more information.

== How To Generate the Book

You can generate the e-book files manually with Asciidoctor.
If you run the following you _may_ actually get HTML, Epub, Mobi and PDF output files:

----
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
