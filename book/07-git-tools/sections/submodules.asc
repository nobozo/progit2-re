[[_git_submodules]]
=== Submodules

Often, while working on one project, you need to use another project from within it.
Perhaps it's a library that a third party developed or that you're developing separately
and using in multiple parent projects. A common issue in these scenarios is how
to treat the two projects as separate yet still be able to use one from within the other.

Here's an example.
Suppose you're developing a website and creating Atom feeds.
Instead of writing your own Atom-generating code, you decide to use a library that already exists.
You're likely to either include this code from a shared library, like a CPAN install or Ruby gem,
or copy the source code into your own project tree.
The issue with including a shared library is that it's difficult to customize the library in any
way and often more difficult to deploy it, because you need to make sure every client has that library
available. The issue with copying the code into your own project is that any custom changes you make
are difficult to merge when changes to the library become available.

Git addresses this issue by using submodules.
They allow keeping a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository.
This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.

[[_starting_submodules]]
==== Starting with Submodules

We walk through developing a simple project that has been split up into a main project and a few sub-projects.

Let's start by adding an existing Git repository as a submodule of the repository that we're working on.
To add a new submodule, run `git submodule add` with the absolute or relative URL of the project you'd
like to start tracking. In this example, we add a library called `DbConnector`.

[source,console]
----
$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
Cloning into 'DbConnector'...
remote: Counting objects: 11, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 0), reused 11 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
----

By default, `git submodule` adds the subproject into a directory with the same name as the repository -
in this case `DbConnector`. You can add a different path at the end of the command to use a different name.

If you run `git status` at this point, you notice a few things.

[source,console]
----
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   .gitmodules
	new file:   DbConnector
----

First you should notice the new `.gitmodules` file.
This is a configuration file that stores the mapping between the project's URL and the local
subdirectory where the submodule is located.

[source,ini]
----
[submodule "DbConnector"]
	path = DbConnector
	url = https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
----

If you have multiple submodules, you have multiple entries in this file.
It's important to note that this file is version-controlled with the other files, like `.gitignore`.
It's pushed and pulled with the rest of your project.
This is how other people who clone this project know where to get submodule projects from.

[NOTE]
=====
Since the URL in `.gitmodules` is what other people first try to clone or fetch from,
make sure to use a URL that they can access. For example, if you use a different URL to push
to than others would use to pull from, use the one that others can access. You can overwrite this
value locally with `git config submodule.DbConnector.url PRIVATE_URL`.
=====

The other listing in the `git status` output is the project directory name.
If you run `git diff` on that, you see something interesting.

[source,console]
----
$ git diff --cached DbConnector
diff --git a/DbConnector b/DbConnector
new file mode 160000
index 0000000..c3f01dc

+++ b/DbConnector

+Subproject commit c3f01dc8862123d317dd46284b05b6892c7b29bc
----

Although `DbConnector` is a subdirectory in your working directory, Git sees it as a submodule and doesn't
track its content when you're not in that directory. Instead, Git sees it as a particular commit.

For a little nicer output, pass the `--submodule` flag to `git diff`.

[source,console]
----
$ git diff --cached --submodule
diff --git a/.gitmodules b/.gitmodules

----

When you commit, you see something like

[source,console]
----
$ git commit -am 'added DbConnector module'

 create mode 160000 DbConnector
----

Notice the `160000` mode for `DbConnector`.
That's a special mode in Git that means you're recording a commit as a directory entry
rather than as a subdirectory or file.

Finally, push the changes.

[source,console]
----
$ git push origin master

[[_cloning_submodules]]
==== Cloning a Project with Submodules

Here we clone a project containing a submodule.
When you clone such a project, by default you get the directories that contain submodules,
but none of the files within them yet.

[source,console]
----

$ cd DbConnector/
$ ls
$
----

An empty `DbConnector` directory is there.
You must run two commands - `git submodule init` to initialize your local configuration file,
and `git submodule update` to fetch all the files from that project and check out the
appropriate commit listed in your superproject.

[source,console]
----
$ git submodule init
Submodule 'DbConnector' (https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector) registered for path 'DbConnector'
$ git submodule update
Cloning into 'DbConnector'...
remote: Counting objects: 11, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.

Submodule path 'DbConnector': checked out 'c3f01dc8862123d317dd46284b05b6892c7b29bc'
----

Now your `DbConnector` subdirectory is in the exact state it was in when you committed earlier.

There's another way to do this which is a little simpler, however. If you add `--recursive` to `git clone`,
Git automatically initializes and updates each submodule in the repository.

[source,console]
----

==== Working on a Project with Submodules

Now we have a copy of a project containing submodules. We collaborate with our teammates
on both the main project and the submodule project.

===== Pulling in Upstream Changes

The simplest way to use submodules in a project would be if you were simply consuming a subproject
and wanted to get updates from it from time to time but weren't actually modifying anything.
Let's walk through a simple example.

To check for new work in a submodule, go into the directory and run `git fetch` and `git merge`
on the original repository to update the local code.

[source,console]
----
$ git fetch
From https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
   c3f01dc..d0354fc  master     -> origin/master
$ git merge origin/master
Updating c3f01dc..d0354fc
Fast-forward
 scripts/connect.sh | 1 +
 src/db.c           | 1 +
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
----

Now if you go back into the main project and run `git diff --submodule` you see that the submodule
was updated, and a list of added commits. If you don't want
to include `--submodule` every time you run `git diff`, set it as the default by
setting the `diff.submodule` config value to `log`.

[source,console]
----
$ git config --global diff.submodule log
$ git diff
Submodule DbConnector c3f01dc..d0354fc:
  > more efficient db routine
  > better connection routine
----

If you commit at this point then you lock the submodule to have the new code when other people update.

There's an easier way to do this as well, if you prefer to not manually fetch and merge in the subdirectory.
If you run `git submodule update --remote`, Git goes into your submodules and does the fetch
and update for you.

[source,console]
----
$ git submodule update --remote DbConnector
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 2), reused 4 (delta 2)
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
From https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
   3f19983..d0354fc  master     -> origin/master
Submodule path 'DbConnector': checked out 'd0354fc054692d3906c85c3af05ddce39a1c0644'
----

This command by default assumes that you want to update the checkout to the `master` branch
of the submodule repository. You can, however, set this to something different. For example,
to have the DbConnector submodule track that repository's `stable` branch,
set it in either your `.gitmodules` file (so everyone else also tracks it),
or just in your local `.git/config` file. Let's set it in `.gitmodules`.

[source,console]
----
$ git config -f .gitmodules submodule.DbConnector.branch stable

$ git submodule update --remote
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 2), reused 4 (delta 2)
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
From https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
   27cf5d3..c87d55d  stable -> origin/stable
Submodule path 'DbConnector': checked out 'c87d55d4c6d4b05ee34fbc8cb6f7bf4585ae6687'
----

If you leave off `-f .gitmodules` Git only makes the change for you, but it probably makes more
sense to track that information in the repository so everyone else does as well.

When we run `git status` at this point, Git shows that we have new commits in the submodule.

[source,console]
----
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  modified:   .gitmodules
  modified:   DbConnector (new commits)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
----

If you set the configuration setting `status.submodulesummary`, Git also shows
a short summary of changes to your submodules.

[source,console]
----
$ git config status.submodulesummary 1

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   .gitmodules
	modified:   DbConnector (new commits)

Submodules changed but not updated:

* DbConnector c3f01dc...c87d55d (4):
  > catch non-null terminated lines
----

At this point if we run `git diff` we see both that we've modified `.gitmodules` and
also that there are a number of commits that we've pulled down and are ready to commit to our submodule project.

[source,console]
----
$ git diff
diff --git a/.gitmodules b/.gitmodules
index 6fc0b3d..fd1cc29 100644

This is pretty cool as we can actually see the list of commits that we're about to commit into our submodule.
Once committed, you can see the list after the fact by running `git log -p`.

Git, by default, tries to update *all* your submodules when you run `git submodule update --remote` so
if you have a lot of submodules, you may want to just pass the name of the one you want to update.

===== Working on a Submodule

It's quite likely that if you're using submodules, you're doing so because you really want to work
on the code in the submodule at the same time that you're working on the code in the main project
(or across several submodules). Otherwise you'd probably instead be using a simpler dependency
management system (such as Maven or Rubygems).

So now let's go through an example of making changes to the submodule at the same time as the main project,
and committing and publishing those changes at the same time.

So far, when we've run `git submodule update` to fetch changes from the submodule repositories,
Git would get the changes and update the files in the subdirectory but leave the sub-repository in what's
called a `detached HEAD` state. This means that there's no local working branch (like `master`, for example)
tracking changes. So any changes you make aren't being tracked.
With no working branch tracking changes, that means even if you commit changes
to the submodule, those changes quite possibly are lost the next time you
run `git submodule update`. You have to do some extra steps if you want changes
in a submodule to be tracked.

In order to set up your submodule to be easier to hack on, do two things.
Go into each submodule and check out a branch to work on. Then tell Git what to do if you've
made changes, and then run `git submodule update --remote` to pull new work from upstream.
You can either merge them into your local work, or you can try to rebase your local work
on top of the new changes.

First of all, let's go into our submodule directory and check out a branch.

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout stable
Switched to branch 'stable'
----

Let's try the `--merge` flag. To specify it manually, just add the `--merge` flag to `git submodule update`.
Here we see that there was a change on the server for this submodule which gets merged in.

[source,console]
----
$ git submodule update --remote --merge
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 2), reused 4 (delta 2)
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.

 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
Submodule path 'DbConnector': merged in '92c7337b30ef9e0893e758dac2459d07362ab5ea'
----

If we go into the DbConnector directory, we have the new changes already merged into our
local `stable` branch. Now let's see what happens when we make our own local change to the library
and someone else pushes another change upstream at the same time.

[source,console]
----
$ cd DbConnector/
$ vim src/db.c
$ git commit -am 'unicode support'
[stable f906e16] unicode support
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
----

Now if we update our submodule we see what happens when we've made a local change and upstream
also has a change we need to incorporate.

[source,console]
----
$ git submodule update --remote --rebase
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: unicode support
Submodule path 'DbConnector': rebased into '5d60ef9bbebf5a0c1c1050f242ceeb54ad58da94'
----

If you forget `--rebase` or `--merge`, Git just updates the submodule to whatever is on the remote
server and resets your project to a detached `HEAD` state.

[source,console]
----
$ git submodule update --remote
Submodule path 'DbConnector': checked out '5d60ef9bbebf5a0c1c1050f242ceeb54ad58da94'
----

If this happens, don't worry. You can simply go back and check out your branch again (which still
contains your work) and merge or rebase `origin/stable` (or any remote branch) manually.

If you haven't committed the changes in your submodule and you run a `git submodule update` that
would cause issues, Git fetches the changes but doesn't overwrite unsaved work in your submodule directory.

[source,console]
----
$ git submodule update --remote
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.

----

You can go into the submodule directory and fix the conflict just as you normally would.

[[_publishing_submodules]]
===== Publishing Submodule Changes

Now we have some changes in our submodule directory. Some of these were brought in from upstream
by our updates and others were made locally and aren't available to anyone else since we haven't
pushed them yet.

[source,console]
----
$ git diff
Submodule DbConnector c87d55d..82d2ad3:
  > Merge from origin/stable
  > updated setup script
  > unicode support
  > remove unnecessary method
  > add new option for conn pooling
----

If we commit in the main project and push without including the submodule changes as well,
other people who try to check out our changes are going to be in trouble since they have no way
to get the necessary submodule changes. Those changes only exist in our local copy.

In order to make sure this doesn't happen, tell Git to check that all your submodules have been
pushed properly before pushing the main project. `git push` takes the `--recurse-submodules` flag
which can be set to either `check` or `on-demand`. The `check` option makes `push` simply fail
if any of the committed submodule changes haven't been pushed.

[source,console]
----
$ git push --recurse-submodules=check
The following submodule paths contain changes that can
not be found on any remote:
  DbConnector

Please try

	git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand

or cd to the path and use

	git push

to push them to a remote.
----

It also gives some helpful advice on what we might want to do next. The simple option is to go into each
submodule and manually push to the remotes to make sure they're externally available and then try
this push again. To make the check behavior the default for all pushes,
run `git config push.recurseSubmodules check`.

The other option is to use the `on-demand` option, which tries to do this for you.

[source,console]
----
$ git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand

Delta compression using up to 8 threads.

   3d6d338..9a377d1  master -> master
----

As you see, Git went into the DbConnector module and pushed it before pushing the main project.
If that submodule push fails for some reason, the main project push also fails.
To make this behavior the default, run `git config push.recurseSubmodules on-demand`.

===== Merging Submodule Changes

If you change a submodule reference at the same time as someone else, you may run into problems.
That is, if the submodule histories have diverged and are committed to diverging branches in a superproject,
they may take a bit of work to fix.

If one of the commits is a direct ancestor of the other (a fast-forward merge),
then Git simply chooses the latter for the merge, so that works fine.

Git doesn't attempt even a trivial merge, however. If the submodule commits diverge and need to be merged,
you see something like

[source,console]
----
$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 2, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 2 (delta 1), reused 2 (delta 1)
Unpacking objects: 100% (2/2), done.

Fetching submodule DbConnector
warning: Failed to merge submodule DbConnector (merge following commits not found)
Auto-merging DbConnector
CONFLICT (submodule): Merge conflict in DbConnector
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
----

So basically what happened here is that Git figured out that the two branches record points in the
submodule's history that are divergent and need to be merged. It shows the warning `merge following commits not found`,
which is confusing but we explain it in a bit.

To solve the problem, you need to figure out what state the submodule should be in. Strangely,
Git doesn't really give you much information to help out here, not even the SHA-1 hashes of the commits
of both sides of the history. Fortunately, it's simple to figure out. If you run `git diff` you get the
SHA-1 hashes of the commits recorded in both branches you were trying to merge.

[source,console]
----
$ git diff
diff --cc DbConnector
index eb41d76,c771610..0000000
--- a/DbConnector
+++ b/DbConnector
----

So, in this case, `eb41d76` is the commit in our submodule that we had and `c771610` is the commit that
upstream had. If we go into our submodule directory, it should already be on `eb41d76` since the merge
wouldn't have touched it. If for whatever reason it's not, simply create and checkout a branch pointing to it.

What's important is the SHA-1 hash of the commit from the other side.
This is what you have to merge and resolve. You can either just try the merge with the SHA-1
hash directly, or you can create a branch for it and then try to merge that in. We'd suggest the latter,
even if only to make a nicer merge commit message.

So, we go into our submodule directory, create a branch based on that second SHA-1 hash from `git diff`,
and manually merge.

[source,console]
----
$ cd DbConnector

$ git rev-parse HEAD
eb41d764bccf88be77aced643c13a7fa86714135

then we can simply update the main project with the result.

It can be a bit confusing, but it's really not very hard.

Interestingly, there's another case that Git handles.
If a merge commit exists in the submodule directory that contains both commits in its history,
Git suggests it to you as a possible solution. It sees that at some point in the submodule's history,
someone merged branches containing these two commits, so maybe you want that one.

This is why the error message from before was `merge following commits not found`,
because Git couldn't do *this*. It's confusing because who would expect it to try to do this?

If it does find a single acceptable merge commit, you see something like

[source,console]
----
$ git merge origin/master
warning: Failed to merge submodule DbConnector (not fast-forward)
Found a possible merge resolution for the submodule:
 9fd905e5d7f45a0d4cbc43d1ee550f16a30e825a: > merged our changes
If this is correct simply add it to the index for example
by using:

  git update-index --cacheinfo 160000 9fd905e5d7f45a0d4cbc43d1ee550f16a30e825a "DbConnector"

which will accept this suggestion.
Auto-merging DbConnector
CONFLICT (submodule): Merge conflict in DbConnector
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
----

It's suggesting that you update the index as if you had run `git add`, which clears the conflict,
then commit. You probably shouldn't do this though. You can just as easily go into the submodule directory,
see what the difference is, fast-forward to this commit, test it properly, and then commit.

[source,console]
----
$ cd DbConnector/
$ git merge 9fd905e
Updating eb41d76..9fd905e
Fast-forward

$ cd ..
$ git add DbConnector
$ git commit -am 'Fast forwarded to a common submodule child'
----

This accomplishes the same thing, but at least this way you can verify that it works and you have the code
in your submodule directory when you're done.

==== Submodule Tips

There are a few things you can do to make working with submodules a little easier.

===== Submodule Foreach

There's a `git submodule foreach` command to run some arbitrary command in each submodule.
This can be really helpful if you have a number of submodules in the same project.

For example, let's say we want to start a new feature or do a bugfix, and we have work going
on in several submodules. We can easily stash all the work in all our submodules.

[source,console]
----
$ git submodule foreach 'git stash'
Entering 'CryptoLibrary'
No local changes to save
Entering 'DbConnector'
Saved working directory and index state WIP on stable: 82d2ad3 Merge from origin/stable
HEAD is now at 82d2ad3 Merge from origin/stable
----

Then we can create a new branch and switch to it in all our submodules.

[source,console]
----
$ git submodule foreach 'git checkout -b featureA'
Entering 'CryptoLibrary'
Switched to a new branch 'featureA'
Entering 'DbConnector'
Switched to a new branch 'featureA'
----

You get the idea. One really useful thing you can do is produce a nice unified diff of what's
changed in your main project and all your subprojects as well.

[source,console]
----
$ git diff; git submodule foreach 'git diff'
Submodule DbConnector contains modified content
diff --git a/src/main.c b/src/main.c

----

Here we see that we're defining a function in a submodule and calling it in the main project.
This is obviously a simplified example, but hopefully it shows how this may be useful.

===== Useful Aliases

You may want to set up aliases for some of these commands.
They can be quite long and you can't set default configuration options for most of them.
We covered setting up Git aliases in <<ch02-git-basics-chapter#_git_aliases>>,
but here's an example of what you may want to set up if you plan on working with submodules in Git a lot.

[source,console]
----
$ git config alias.sdiff '!'"git diff && git submodule foreach 'git diff'"
$ git config alias.spush 'push --recurse-submodules=on-demand'
$ git config alias.supdate 'submodule update --remote --merge'
----

This way you can simply run `git supdate` when you want to update your submodules,
or `git spush` to push with submodule dependency checking.

==== Issues with Submodules

Using submodules isn't without hiccups, however.

Switching branches containing submodules, for instance, can be tricky.
If you create a new branch, add a submodule there, and then switch back to a branch without that submodule,
you still have the submodule directory as an untracked directory.

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout -b add-crypto
Switched to a new branch 'add-crypto'

$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
Cloning into 'CryptoLibrary'...
...

$ git commit -am 'adding crypto library'
[add-crypto 4445836] adding crypto library
 2 files changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 160000 CryptoLibrary

$ git checkout master
warning: unable to rmdir CryptoLibrary: Directory not empty
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	CryptoLibrary/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
----

Removing the directory isn't difficult, but its presence can be a bit confusing.
If you do remove it and then switch back to the branch that has that submodule,
run `submodule update --init` to repopulate it.

[source,console]
----
$ git clean -ffdx
Removing CryptoLibrary/

$ git checkout add-crypto
Switched to branch 'add-crypto'

$ ls CryptoLibrary/

$ git submodule update --init
Submodule path 'CryptoLibrary': checked out 'b8dda6aa182ea4464f3f3264b11e0268545172af'

$ ls CryptoLibrary/
Makefile	includes	scripts		src
----

Again, not really very difficult, but it can be a little confusing.

The other main caveat that many people run into involves switching from subdirectories to submodules.
If you've been tracking files in your project that you want to move into a submodule,
be careful or else Git gets angry with you.
Assume that you have files in a subdirectory of your project that you want to switch to a submodule.
If you delete the subdirectory and then run `git submodule add`, Git yells at you.

[source,console]
----
$ rm -Rf CryptoLibrary/
$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
'CryptoLibrary' already exists in the index
----

You have to unstage the `CryptoLibrary` directory first.
Then you can add the submodule.

[source,console]
----
$ git rm -r CryptoLibrary
$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
Cloning into 'CryptoLibrary'...
remote: Counting objects: 11, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 0), reused 11 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
----

Now suppose you did that in a branch.
If you try to switch back to a branch where those files are still in the actual tree rather than a submodule,
you get this.

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout master
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
  CryptoLibrary/Makefile
  CryptoLibrary/includes/crypto.h
  ...
Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.
Aborting
----

You can force a switch by running `git checkout -f`, but be careful that you don't have
unsaved changes since they could be overwritten.

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout -f master
warning: unable to rmdir CryptoLibrary: Directory not empty
Switched to branch 'master'
----

Then, when you switch back, you get an empty `CryptoLibrary` directory for some reason and
running `git submodule update` may not fix it. You may need to go into your submodule directory
and run `git checkout .` to get all your files back. You could run this in a `submodule foreach`
script if you have multiple submodules.

It's important to note that submodules these days keep all their Git data in the top
project's `.git` directory, so unlike much older versions of Git, destroying a submodule directory
doesn't lose any commits or branches.

With these tools, submodules can be a fairly simple and effective method for working on several related
but still separate projects simultaneously.
