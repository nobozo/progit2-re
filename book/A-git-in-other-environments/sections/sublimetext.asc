=== Git in Sublime Text

From version 3.2 onwards, Sublime Text has Git integration.

Some features are

* The sidebar will show the Git status of files and folders with a badge/icon.
* Files and folders in .gitignore are faded out in the sidebar.
* The status bar shows the current Git branch and how many modifications it contains.
* All changes to a file are now visible via markers in the gutter.
* You can use part of the Sublime Merge Git client functionality from within Sublime Text.
  (This requires that Sublime Merge is installed. See: https://www.sublimemerge.com/[])
